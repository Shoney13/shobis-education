# ShoBis- Education

An Easy Guide for parents to educate their children

## The Problem

NIOS (the board of education under the Union Government of India) has
all the resources parents need to homeschool their children.

But their UI is not at all intuitive.

There is no easy-to-follow guide. It is not supplemented with other free
resources from around the Internet

## Mission
Our Mission is to make a better and easy to use Website through which
you can access all the resources provided by NIOS
